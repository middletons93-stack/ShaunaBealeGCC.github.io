<h2>Axe Throwing</h2>

<p class="review">'The archery was brilliant, but not as good as axe throwing, I never thought we’d be allowed to do that! I got one of my axes right in the middle of the target’- Scott. Aged 13</p>

<p class="body">
    Take yourself back to a time of Vikings and have a go at throwing an axe.<br>
    Try to hit the target, better yet throw yourself a bullseye.<br><br>
